Using **Ruby for embedded development** is uncommon, but can be a valid choice in some niche scenarios.

---
class: center, middle

## Reasons to Consider Ruby for Embedded Development

---
class: center, middle

### High Productivity

---

- **expressive, concise syntax** and powerful metaprogramming make development fast and readable.

- Useful for **prototyping**, **configuration scripts**, or **control logic** where development speed outweighs performance concerns.

---
class: center, middle

### **mruby: Lightweight Ruby**

---

- Compiles Ruby to C bytecode.

- Can be embedded into C/C++ programs.

- Small memory footprint (can run on devices with \~100-300KB RAM).

- Good for scripting within constrained environments.

---
class: center, middle

Implements a subset of Ruby (no full stdlib, no threads, no GC tuning)

---

| Feature               | CRuby (MRI)                   | mruby                                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gem Manager**       | `RubyGems` + `Bundler`        | `mgem` (for `mrbgems`)                                   |
| **Install Gems**      | Runtime (`gem install`)       | Build time (linked at compile)                           |
| **Popular Gems**      | Rails, Nokogiri, Puma, RSpec  | Custom gems like `mruby-io`, `mruby-print`, `mruby-time` |
| **Native Extensions** | Supported (`C`, `Rust`, etc.) | ❌ Not supported in the same way                          |
| **Dynamic Loading**   | ✅ (`require`, `load`)         | ⚠️ Limited; most loading is static (at compile time)     |

---
class: center, middle

Used in games (e.g., by Nintendo), routers, small devices

---
class: center, middle

### **Interactive Configuration or Scripting**

---
class: center, middle

Embedded devices that offer user customization or configuration may benefit from a high-level scripting language like Ruby.

---
class: center, middle

*Example:* A network device or appliance with Ruby scripts to configure settings.

---
class: center, middle

### **Testing and DevOps in Embedded**

---
class: center, middle

Useful for **test harnesses**, **firmware test frameworks**, or **log parsing**.

---
class: center, middle

### **Limitations and Tradeoffs** of using Ruby for embedded

---

- Performance in real-time, polling use-cases

- Memory usage

- Ecosystem Fit

---
class: center, middle

Interpreted Ruby (MRI) is large and slow compared to C/C++, Rust, or even Lua and Python.

---
class: center, middle

Standard Ruby (MRI) needs tens of MB of RAM, which is unsuitable for most MCUs.

---
class: center, middle

Even **mruby**, while light, is still heavier than Lua or C.

---
class: center, middle

Most embedded libraries, drivers, and vendor SDKs are written in C/C++.

---
class: center, middle

Ruby lacks ecosystem support for **hardware interaction** (I²C, SPI, UART, GPIO) unless you write C extensions or bindings manually.

---

| Scenario                | Why Ruby?                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Embedded Linux devices  | Use full Ruby for scripting and UI logic (e.g., industrial panels, routers). |
| Scripting inside C apps | Embed mruby for dynamic behavior without recompilation.                      |
| Configuration UIs       | Ruby DSLs or Sinatra-based apps for internal device configuration.           |
| Testing & automation    | Ruby is great for firmware validation, simulation, and tooling.              |

## Building Ruby with [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) / [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)

---

| Goal                                  | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 **Minimal Custom Linux**           | Both Buildroot and Yocto help you create a **lean, custom Linux OS** with just enough to run your Ruby application.         |
| 📦 **Bundled Ruby Runtime**           | You can cross-compile Ruby and bundle it directly into the root filesystem. No need for external dependencies at runtime.   |
| 🛠️ **Cross-compilation Support**     | Ruby is built natively for your target hardware (e.g., ARM, RISC-V), not your dev machine. These tools handle that cleanly. |
| 🔐 **Security & Control**             | Smaller attack surface and deterministic builds—useful for appliances, routers, kiosks, etc., that need Ruby scripting.     |
| 🚀 **Faster Boot, Lower RAM/Storage** | You avoid bloat by skipping package managers, GUI libs, or unwanted features. Ideal for headless devices.                   |
| 🔁 **Reproducible Builds**            | Both systems allow **rebuilding the full image** from scratch, useful for versioned releases and CI pipelines.              |

In the **Yocto Project**, **Poky** is the **reference distribution** and the **build system**.

---
class: center, middle

It's the central piece that combines all core Yocto components to let you build complete embedded Linux systems.

---

### Breakdown: What *Poky* Includes

Poky is a Git repository that bundles:

1. **BitBake** – the task executor and core build engine.
2. **meta/** – core metadata recipes for building Linux (e.g., GCC, systemd, BusyBox, etc.).
3. **meta-poky/** – reference distribution layer with configuration, image recipes, etc.
4. **meta-yocto-bsp/** – board support packages (BSPs) for reference hardware (e.g., QEMU).
5. Configuration templates (e.g., `local.conf`, `bblayers.conf`) to get you started.

---

### Purpose of Poky

- **Reference Implementation**: It shows how to structure a working Yocto project.

- **Starting Point**: You can clone Poky and then add your own layers (e.g., `meta-mycompany`) for your product.

- **Example Layers**: Shows how to use best practices with layers, configuration, and recipes.

---

### Structure Example (when you clone poky)

```bash
poky/
├── bitbake/             # BitBake engine
├── meta/                # Core metadata
├── meta-poky/           # Reference distribution configs
├── meta-yocto-bsp/      # BSPs for QEMU and other boards
├── oe-init-build-env    # Setup script for environment
└── scripts/             # Helper scripts
```

---
class: center, middle

> **Poky = BitBake + core metadata + sample config layers (meta-poky, BSPs)**

---
class: center, middle

> It's the **official Yocto reference build system** used to build and test Linux distros for embedded systems.

---
class: center, middle

```bash
git clone -b langdale https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky.git
```

---
class: center, middle

```bash
source oe-init-build-env
```

---

In `build/conf/local.conf`, add:

```bash
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " ruby"
```

---
class: center, middle

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

This will take a while the first time (\~1–2 hours depending on CPU/network).

---
class: center, middle

```bash
runqemu qemuarm
```

#### Possibilities with Yocto

---
class: center, middle

##### 1. **Reducing Ruby Interpreter Size**

---
class: center, middle

```bash
./configure \
  --disable-install-doc \
  --without-gmp \
  --disable-rpath \
  --with-out-ext=tk,sdbm,gdbm,win32,dbm \
  --enable-load-relative
```

---
class: center, middle

```bash
strip ruby
```

---
class: center, middle

##### 2. **Minimizing Gems**

---

🪓 Avoid:

- `bundler`

- Full Rubygems CLI (especially on embedded)

---

✅ Use **vendor mode**

Install gems on the host system, then **vendor** them:

```bash
bundle config set --local deployment true
bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle

bundle install
```

---
class: center, middle

Then copy only:

```
vendor/bundle/ruby/*/gems/<your-gems>
vendor/bundle/ruby/*/gems/<your-gems>/lib/
```

---
class: center, middle

##### 🪛 3. **Static Gems or Packaging Ruby Code**

---

- Place scripts in `/usr/share/myapp/*.rb`

- Write a small wrapper script (e.g., `/usr/bin/myapp`):

  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh
  exec ruby /usr/share/myapp/start.rb "$@"
  ```

---

✅ Convert into a single binary (optional):

Tools like [Travelling Ruby](https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby) or even [mruby](https://mruby.org/) let you ship small interpreters with embedded scripts, though **mruby lacks many gems and standard Ruby features**.

---
class: center, middle

##### 🔧 4. **Yocto Specific Tips**

---
class: center, middle

Ruby comes from `meta-oe` (bitbake `ruby`)

---

- To reduce size:

  - Use `.bbappend` to modify `do_install` and remove files

  - Strip binaries in `do_install_append()`

---

- To vendor gems:

  - Write a custom recipe for your app

  - Install your app into image via `IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " myrubyapp"`

---

### What to Keep vs. Strip

| Component         | Keep? | Why/Why Not                                |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Core interpreter  | ✅     | Required                                   |
| Rubygems CLI      | ❌     | Avoid if not installing gems at runtime    |
| Bundler           | ❌     | Adds size; unnecessary in production       |
| Extension headers | ❌     | Strip post-build                           |
| Documentation     | ❌     | Use `--disable-install-doc`                |
| Stdlib (partial)  | ✅/⚠️  | Keep only required ones (e.g. `fileutils`) |

---

### Test for Unused Libs

After building, run in QEMU:

```bash
ldd `which ruby`
```

---

Check for:

- Unnecessary dynamic links (e.g. `libgmp`, `libreadline`)

- Strip or link statically if needed

---
class: center, middle

### Static vs Dynamic Linking

---
class: center, middle

#### 🧱 Definitions (Quick Recap)

---
class: center, middle

**Static Linking**: All libraries (e.g., `libc`, `libpthread`, `libm`, etc.) are compiled into the Ruby binary itself.

---

##### 🛠️ How (Buildroot Example)

```bash
make menuconfig
→ Toolchain
  → [*] Build static libraries
→ Target packages → Interpreter Languages → Ruby
→ Build Options → [*] Enable static build
```

---

Or patch Ruby’s `./configure`:

```bash
./configure LDFLAGS="-static"
```

---

You also need to:

```bash
export RUBY_STATIC=true
```

---
class: center, middle

Yocto static linking is harder (some recipes don't support `--enable-static` cleanly), but you can patch `ruby_%.bbappend` and tweak `EXTRA_OECONF`.

---
class: center, middle

**Dynamic Linking**: Ruby binary references shared libraries (`.so` files) at runtime, loaded from `/lib`, `/usr/lib`, etc.

---

##### 🛠️ How (default in Buildroot and Yocto)

Just build Ruby normally — it will link against shared libs like:

```bash
ldd `which ruby`
```

---

Example:

```
libm.so.6 => /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libm.so.6
libpthread.so.0 => /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpthread.so.0
libc.so.6 => /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6
```

---

#### ⚖️ When to Use Which?

| Scenario                             | Static | Dynamic |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Minimal rootfs or BusyBox-only image | ✅      | ❌       |
| QEMU/real hardware with glibc/musl   | ✅/⚠️   | ✅       |
| You want to copy 1 binary and run    | ✅      | ❌       |
| Need smaller storage use overall     | ❌      | ✅       |
| You want flexibility to update       | ❌      | ✅       |
| You control the full rootfs layout   | ✅      | ✅       |

---

#### 🔍 Mixed Strategy (Hybrid)

You can:

- Statically link Ruby itself

- Dynamically link non-core tools (e.g., systemd, openssl)

- Use static Ruby with vendored gems (pure Ruby only, no native extensions)

## Working with Files

---
class: center, middle

## Raw Sockets

---
class: center, middle

## Creating & managing processes

---

- `fork` - Creates a **child Ruby process**. Both parent and child continue execution.

- `exec` - **Replaces** the current Ruby process with an external command. **Never returns** if successful.

- `system` - Run a command, wait for it to finish. Returns: true if exit status is 0, false otherwise.

- `spawn` - Starts a **new external process**. Returns immediately with the PID. Ruby keeps running.

- Backticks ( `cmd` / `%x{}` ) - Runs a shell command and **returns its output** as a string. **Blocks until done**.

---

Can't use stdin with:

| Method                  | stdin support                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| backticks               | ❌ No stdin control                          |
| `exec`                  | ❌ Replaces Ruby process; no stdin from Ruby |
| `system`                | 🚫 Limited — no direct stdin control         |

---
class: center, middle

### Ways to Pass to stdin

---
class: center, middle

`IO.popen` vs `spawn` vs `Open3.popen2`

---

| Method         | Can write to stdin?  | Can read output?  | Notes                         |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `IO.popen`     | ✅                   | ✅                | Simple and versatile          |
| `spawn` + pipe | ✅                   | ✅                | Needs manual pipe setup       |
| `Open3.popen2` | ✅                   | ✅                | Cleaner, safer subprocess API |
| `` `cmd` ``    | ❌                   | ✅                | Output only                   |
| `exec`         | ❌                   | ❌                | Replaces Ruby process         |

---
class: center, middle

## Blocks vs Procs vs Lambda

---
class: center, middle

A block is a chunk of code enclosed in {} or do...end, passed to a method implicitly.

---
class: center, middle

A Proc is an instance of the Proc class. It allows you to store a block in a variable.

---
class: center, middle

A lambda is a special kind of Proc with stricter rules.

---
class: center, middle

## Taking a closer look at variables in Ruby

---
class: center, middle

Ruby is pass by `?`

---
class: center, middle

Everything in Ruby is an object...

---
class: center, middle

...and variables hold references, not the actual objects.

---
class: center, middle

### Mutability

---
class: center, middle

Some Ruby objects are mutable (can change in place), others are immutable.

---

| Type                   | Mutable? |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| `String`               | ✅ Yes    |
| `Array`                | ✅ Yes    |
| `Hash`                 | ✅ Yes    |
| `Integer`              | ❌ No     |
| `Symbol`               | ❌ No     |
| `true`, `false`, `nil` | ❌ No     |

---
class: center, middle

Enforcing mutability using: `.freeze`

---
class: center, middle

### What about cloning?

---
class: center, middle

`dup` vs `clone`

---

| Feature                   | `dup`            | `clone`                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Copies frozen state?      | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes                         |
| Copies singleton methods? | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes (in some Ruby versions) |
| Typical use               | Lightweight copy | Exact replica                 |

---
class: center, middle

## Managing memory & object state

---
class: center, middle

Ruby’s heap, object lifecycle, and the ObjectSpace module all tie together to manage memory and object state behind the scenes.

---
class: center, middle

Ruby’s heap is not the system heap (`malloc`), but a custom managed heap of object slots (called `RVALUE`s).

---
class: center, middle

`ObjectSpace`
